# 🌟 Atlantic Hurricane Data Classification & Analysis - Excel Project

### 🎯 Project Overview: Advanced Data Classification and Reporting

This project showcases expertise in **Microsoft Excel** for comprehensive data transformation, analysis, and dynamic reporting using a historical Atlantic hurricane dataset. The primary technical focus is on utilizing the efficient **SWITCH function** to classify data, demonstrating a modern approach to handling conditional logic.

The goal was to transform raw historical data on storm intensity, wind speed, and damage into actionable, categorized insights.

### 🛠️ Advanced Excel Skills & Features Demonstrated

| Feature | Function/Tool | Purpose in Project |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Efficient Classification** | **SWITCH Function** | **The core technical highlight.** Used to create a streamlined, modern formula for translating the numeric Saffir-Simpson `Category*` (1-5) into its detailed textual descriptor (e.g., "Catastrophic," "Major Hurricane"), replacing cumbersome nested `IF` statements. |
| **Data Visualization** | **Conditional Formatting** | Applied visual rules (e.g., Color Scales or Icon Sets) to the `Damage (USD Millions)` and `Max Wind Speed` columns to instantly highlight the most severe and financially costly events. |
| **Data Integrity & Review** | **Filtering & Sorting** | Utilized multi-level sorting and advanced filtering to quickly isolate, compare, and rank hurricanes based on their `Category*` and financial `Damage`. |
| **Presentation** | **Custom Formatting** | Applied professional custom number formats (Currency, Millions) to ensure the data is clearly and consistently presented for stakeholders. |

### 📁 Data Source

The analysis is based on a historical dataset of the biggest Atlantic hurricanes, providing records for detailed risk and impact assessment.

| File Name | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes -1 - Copy arooj.xlsx - Biggest Atlantic Hurricanes.csv` | **Main Data Set:** Contains historical records including `Name`, `Start Date`, estimated `Damage (USD Millions)`, Saffir-Simpson `Category*`, and `Max Wind Speed`. |

### 💡 Key Analytical Insights & Takeaways

* **Modern Formula Application:** Successfully utilized the **SWITCH function**, showcasing proficiency in modern, efficient Excel coding practices for complex classification logic.
* **Risk Assessment:** The project provides a clear visual breakdown of how many historical storms fall into the most destructive categories (4 and 5), quantifying the historical threat level.
* **Financial Impact:** Through filtering and analysis, the project isolates the top N most financially devastating hurricanes, crucial for risk management discussions.
